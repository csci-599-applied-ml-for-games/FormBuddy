# FormBuddy
Welcome to Project FormBuddy for the CSCI 599 Machine Learning for Games class! The goal for this project is to create an application that can evaluate and give advice on correcting a userâ€™s lifting form in real time. We are in the beginning stages of our project, but we plan on using pose estimation capabilities combined with our own machine learning and deep learning code to develop a fun and interactive application capable of helping people use the proper form while weightlifting.
